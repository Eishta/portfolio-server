    "intro": "Hello, my name is Eishta Mittal. I have over 6 years of experience as a Software Developer. My interest in web development began in 2018 when I was assigned my first task at Sopra Steria. The enjoyment of designing and experimenting with the user interface fascinated me. I found it exhilarating, and since then, it has been an integral part of my journey. Delving deeper into frontend development, I have explored React JS, Ember JS, and Vue. Currently, my primary focus is on learning Next JS and server-side rendering. "
